h2. Saikuro Treemap Generator

This gem generates a "treemap":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping
showing the complexity of ruby code on which it is run. It uses 
"Saikuro":http://saikuro.rubyforge.org/ under the covers to analyze ruby
code complexity.

The size of blocks in the treemap is representative of the size of the
code element represented by that block. The color of the block indicates
complexity of that particular code element. Green is good, red is bad, 
blue is somewhere in between.

Small evenly distributed blocks which are green in color is indicative of
good code.

h2. Usage

We clearly need to make the gem install a bit easier, but for now:

* checkout this repos from github
* >rake gem to build the saikuro_treemap gem
* install saikuro_treemap gem
* add a rake task like below to your project, adjusting :code_dirs for your project:

<pre>
    namespace :metrics do
      desc 'generate ccn treemap'
      task :ccn_treemap do
        SaikuroTreemap.generate_treemap :code_dirs => ['lib']
        `open reports/saikuro_treemap.html`
      end
    end
</pre> 
  
* run the task to see the treemap in your browser
